# Mesh:Tool

## About

[Mesh:Tool](https://grid.space/mesh) is an intentionally simplified tool designed to address the most common cases of mesh editing and repair. It is under active development with new features daily or weekly. This means the docs can get out of date quickly.

Mesh:Tool is part of the [Grid.Apps GitHub Repo](https://github.com/GridSpace/grid-apps) and is Open Source under the [MIT License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License). It runs entirely in browser, is not connected to the cloud, and does not collect or share any model data. [Desktop builds](https://github.com/GridSpace/grid-apps/releases) are available whiel start in the Slicer view. Use the central drop-menu to switch to Mesh:Tool.

## Getting Started

It's as simple as dropping models onto the workspace or clicking the import button. Models dropped or imported together will be grouped together. Supported types: STL, OBJ, SVG, Gerber

## 3D and 2D Editing

There are two primary modes of operation: 3D Mesh and 2D Sketch. Use the Mode menu to select or clicking on an object or sketch will automatically change modes.

3D Meshes can be booleaned and faces reparied. Importing 2D file formats when in Object mode will result in auto-extrusion.

2D Sketch entities can be drawn directly or come from imports of SVG or Gerber files. Select a sketch to import 2D file components. Sketches or selections can be extruded parametrically.
