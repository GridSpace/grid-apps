# Interface

Kiri:Moto's interface is designed for maximum access to the workspace and to present only the options that are necessary and relevant to the current action.

The left menus control workspace, work mode, and objects while.

The right menus control the behavior and settings for slicing, path routing, and path to code exports.

[OBJ](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mbz/personal/graphics/obj.html), [STL](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format)>), and [3MF](https://docs.fileformat.com/3d/3mf/) files import natively. [SVG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics), [JPG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG_File_Interchange_Format), and [PNG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics) are auto-extruded into a 3D parts.
