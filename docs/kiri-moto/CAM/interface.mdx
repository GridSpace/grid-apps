# Interface

The CAM interface is in most regards the same as the [general interface](/kiri-moto/interface). It is highly reccommended to familiarize yourself with the general interface before using the CAM interface.

With that in mind, Here are the key differences:

- Operation list

  The Operation list defines the order in which Operations are
  done on the model. Selecting the Plus button will open a popup
  menu for selecting an Operation to add. The Operations are
  draggable, enabling easy re-ordering. An operation can be
  disabled by ctrl+clicking it. disabled operations will be
  skipped in the slice/preview/export process. Finally,
  The thin blue bar in the Operation list is also draggable.
  moving the bar automitically disables all operations below it. 
  This allows you to slice, preview and export up to a specific 
  point in the timeline

  <ImageCarousel base="/img/CAM/interface/" images="camInterface" />

- Origin selection

  Origin selection, a feature released in v4.3 enables automatically setting an origin to points on interest on the model, including corners and arc centers.
