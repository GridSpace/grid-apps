# Interface

The CAM interface is, in most respects, the same as the [general interface](/kiri-moto/interface). It is highly recommended to familiarize yourself with the general interface before using the CAM interface.

With that in mind, here are the key differences:

## Operation List

  The Operation List defines the order in which operations are
  performed on the model. Selecting the **plus** button will open a
  popup menu for choosing an operation to add. The operations are
  draggable, enabling easy re-ordering.  
  - An operation can be disabled by **Ctrl+clicking** it. Disabled operations will be skipped in the slice/preview/export process.  
  - The thin blue bar in the Operation List is also draggable. Moving the bar automatically disables all operations below it. This allows you to slice, preview, and export up to a specific point in the timeline.

## Origin Selection

  Origin Selection (introduced in v4.3) enables automatically setting an origin to points of interest on the model, including corners and arc centers.
