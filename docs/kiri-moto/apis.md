# API, CLI, Embedding

## Javascript Slicer Engine

The latest slicing engine code is served live at `https://grid.space/code/engine.js`

This can be embedded in your page then accessed with the API calls defined on the [Engine APIs](engine-apis) page.

## Command Line API

The slicer engine is also available as a command-line utility

```
node src/kiri-run/cli --help

cli <options> <file>
   --verbose           | enable verbose logging
   --dir=[dir]         | root directory for file paths (default: '.')
   --model=[file]      | model file to load (or last parameter)
   --source=[file]     | source file list (defaults to kiri engine)
   --device=[file]     | device definition file (json)
   --process=[file]    | process definition file (json)
   --controller=[file] | controller definition file (json)
   --output=[file]     | gcode output to file or '-' for stdout
   --position=x,y,z    | move loaded model to position x,y,z
   --rotate=x,y,z      | rotate loaded model x,y,z radians
   --scale=x,y,z       | scale loaded model in x,y,z
   --move=x,y,z        | move loaded model x,y,z millimeters
```

Example [Device](https://github.com/GridSpace/grid-apps/blob/master/src/cli/kiri-fdm-device.json) and [Process](https://github.com/GridSpace/grid-apps/blob/master/src/cli/kiri-fdm-process.json) settings which are defined in [init.js](https://github.com/GridSpace/grid-apps/blob/master/src/kiri/conf.js) around line `250`

JSON dictionaries can be used for reference from the [CLI package](https://github.com/GridSpace/grid-apps/tree/master/src/cli)

## Embedding Kiri:Moto with an IFrame

Kiri:Moto is designed to be embedded in a page using an IFrame. The look and feel and other controls are available for the loaded page using a messaging API. An example page is [here](https://grid.space/kiri/frame.html).
