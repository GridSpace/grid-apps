# Integrations

## OctoPrint

Use the [GridSpace OctoPrint](https://plugins.octoprint.org/plugins/gridspace/) plugin to spool jobs directly from Kiri:Moto to any printer on your local network

## Onshape

Kiri:Moto is available inside of [Onshape](https://onshape.com/) as a web-app extension. Once [installed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbbZjj5FMGE) through Onshape's App store, Kiri:Moto can be added as a tab (just like a Part Studio) inside of any document in which you have edit capabilities. In this mode, Kiri:Moto's import function is replaced to bring up Onshape's part dialog. This makes it easy to load parts directly for slicing without first having to export them.

## Lychee Slicer

Kiri:Moto's FDM engine is used to power the FDM mode of Mango 3D's [Lychee Slicer](https://lychee.mango3d.io/)

## SimplyPrint.io

Kiri:Moto is the slicing engine behind [SimplyPrint's](https://simplyprint.io/) web-based printer management system.

## Sienci's CAMLab

[CAMLab](http://camlab.sienci.com/camlab) is a fork of an earlier version of Kiri:Moto.

## Thingiverse

Like Onshape, Kiri:Moto is integrated as a native [Thing-app](https://www.thingiverse.com/apps/kirimoto) into Thingiverse. As a user of Thingiverse, you can elect to have Kiri:Moto show up as a "way to open" a Thing file. This provides the convenience of directly accessing, slicing, and printing parts on Thingiverse without first having to download them and then re-import them into a slicer.

Unfortunately, as of this writing, Thingiverse Thing Apps are broken (again)
