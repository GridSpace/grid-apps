# Interface

Kiri:Moto's interface is designed for maximum access to the workspace, showing only the options necessary and relevant to the current action.

[OBJ](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mbz/personal/graphics/obj.html), [STL](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format)>), and [3MF](https://docs.fileformat.com/3d/3mf/) files import natively. [SVG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics), [JPG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG_File_Interchange_Format), and [PNG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics) files are auto-extruded into 3D parts.

For the CAM interface, click [here](/kiri-moto/CAM).

## Top Menu

- **Left:** Buttons to move through the `Arrange → Slice → Preview → Export` workflow. These steps are also available as [keyboard shortcuts](/kiri-moto/controls). Selecting an option here will automatically run prior steps as needed.
- **Center:** Clicking the [logo](/kiri-moto) opens a dialog with version selection, helpful links, and your current Kiri:Moto version. If you are unsure which version to use, check the [release notes](https://github.com/GridSpace/grid-apps/releases/) on GitHub.
- **Right:** Options for importing/exporting the workspace, manipulating the view, changing modes, and setting preferences. Kiri:Moto currently supports CAM, FDM, SLA, and LASER modes. Some other modes are extensions of the LASER workflow, but do not have first-class support. The [preferences menu](#preferences) will be covered later in this section.
  - Changing the mode updates the left menu and enables/disables mode-specific options such as the `CAM Operation` menu and the `CAM Animate` step.
  - Learn about K:M file types [here](/kiri-moto/faq#what-are-the-kmz-and-km-file-formats-short-for).

## Left Menu

The left menu contains options for the current mode. These vary widely:

- CAM has ample documentation on [Process Options](/kiri-moto/CAM/processOpts).
- Other modes are less documented but many options are self-explanatory if you're familiar with the manufacturing process.
- Hovering over an option provides tooltips. When in doubt, a quick search usually explains the option in detail.

## Right Menu

The right menu contains controls for objects in the workspace.

- Hovering over the arrow next to an object reveals options for deleting, renaming, disabling, or replacing it.
- Disabled objects remain visible but are ignored during slicing and exporting.

## Machines Dialog

![Device Dialog](/img/interface/CAMDevice.png)

The device dialog is accessed through the settings dropdown. It allows you to configure a device or select a predefined one.

- The dropdown only shows devices available for the current mode.
- Stock device settings are greyed out. To modify them, click `Customize`.
- Learn more about how K:M handles CAM devices [here](/kiri-moto/CAM/machines).

## Preferences

Application preferences are also accessed through the settings dropdown. These are mode-dependent but share many common options. For example, CNC preferences include animation controls.
