# Interface

Kiri:Moto's interface is designed for maximum access to the workspace and to present only the options that are necessary and relevant to the current action.

[OBJ](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mbz/personal/graphics/obj.html), [STL](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format)>), and [3MF](https://docs.fileformat.com/3d/3mf/) files import natively. [SVG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics), [JPG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG_File_Interchange_Format), and [PNG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics) are auto-extruded into a 3D parts.

## Top menu 

On the left are buttons to move through the Arrange->Slice->Preview->Export workflow . These buttons are also available as [keyboard shortcuts](/kiri-moto/controls). Selecting an option here will automatically move through the prior steps. 

In the center-top, clicking the [logo](/kiri-moto) opens a dialog with options for version selection, helpful links, and a display of your current version of kiri:moto.
if you are unsure which version to select, you can view the [release notes](https://github.com/GridSpace/grid-apps/releases/) on github.

On the right are options for importing/exporting the workspace, manipulating the view, changing the mode, and setting preferences. You can learn about K:M filetypes [here](kiri-moto/faq#what-are-the-kmz-and-km-file-formats-short-for). Changing the mode changes the options available in the left menu, and enables/disables mode-specific options, such as the `CAM Operation` menu, and the `CAM Animate` step. Kiri:Moto currently supports CAM, FDM, SLA, and LASER modes. Some other modes are available as extentions of the laser workflow, but do not have first class support. The [prefrences menu](#prefrences) will be discussed later in this section.

## Left menu

The left menu contains options for the current mode. These vary wildly, and although there is ample documentation on the [CAM Process Options](/kiri-moto/cam/processOpts), the same does not yet exist for the other modes. Many of the options will be self-explanitory for those familiar with the mode of manufacturing they are using, and more detail can be found by hovering over the option. Otherwise, a quick google can typically explain what the option does.

## Right menu

The right menu contains controls for the objects in the workspace. Hovering over the arrow on the left of the object will display options for deleting, renaming, disabling, and replacing the object. if an object is disabled, it will be displayed, but will be ignored in slicing and exporting.



## Machines Dialog

![Device Dialog](/img/interface/CAMDevice.png)

The device dialog can be accessed through the settings dropdown. Once opened, it contains options for configuring a device, or finding a pre-defined one. The device dropdown will only show devices for the current mode. The options inputs will be greyed out and not editable for a stock device. The `customize` button must be selected first, and then the device can be configured. you can find more information about how K:M handles CAM devices [here](/kiri-moto/cam/devices).


## Preferences
Application preferences are accessed through the settings dropdown. They are mode-dependent, but share many common options. For example, CNC preferences show animation controls.
