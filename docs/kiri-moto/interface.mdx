# Interface

Kiri:Moto's interface is designed for maximum access to the workspace and to present only the options that are necessary and relevant to the current action.

## Overview

The top left menus control workspace, work mode, setup, and objects.

The right menus control the behavior and settings for slicing, path routing, and path to code exports.

[OBJ](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mbz/personal/graphics/obj.html), [STL](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format)>), and [3MF](https://docs.fileformat.com/3d/3mf/) files import natively. [SVG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics), [JPG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG_File_Interchange_Format), and [PNG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics) are auto-extruded into a 3D parts.

## CAM Mode

In CNC mode, there is an additional storyboard menu at the bottom where you can plan and re-order milling operations.

## Setup menu

The Device Selection menu offers access to Device selection and customization. It is mode-dependent,
displaying different options and machines for different modes.

## Preferences

Application preferences can be found at the bottom of the setup menu, and are mode-dependent.
For example, CNC preferences show animation controls, whjle other modes do not.

## Version, Help, and Donate

Selecting the Kiri:Moto icon in the top center will open a dropdown for selecting the version you want to use, and provides links to helpful resourses and donation options.

Selecting the `version` button will bring you to the version selection screen,
which will displays the last 5 versions by default. once you chose a version, you must `shift+reload`
to clear the browser cache and start a new session in the new version.
