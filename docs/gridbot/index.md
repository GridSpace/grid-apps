# GridBot

The result of many years of refinement, this 3D printer offers a light-weight, open, yet also rigid design. The clean look is achieved by keeping components like motors and rails inside the frame. This allows for easier enclosure, should that be desirable.

The [CAD model](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/64a8b0664bd09cbffb0e0d17/w/044a002e53008b3bc2a845ec/e/9b8b7abe5b303b24f2f26d14) is shared publicly in Onshape.

An [updated design](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/d0514606a660a802eb16304a/w/43a797f28bcc004e3e7e7e17/e/61abf70c46004ffbc0134231) is in the works. Some photos in the [wiki](https://github.com/GridSpace/grid-bot/wiki).

The [control software](https://github.com/GridSpace/grid-bot) is open source on GitHub. It is a simple GCode sender designed for the Pi 7" touch screen. Better supported options like [OctoPrint](https://octoprint.org/) may be a wise choice unless you are keen to help with development and debugging.

A Beta for a [new design](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/d0514606a660a802eb16304a/w/43a797f28bcc004e3e7e7e17/e/61abf70c46004ffbc0134231) is also available. Check [forum.grid.space](https://forum.grid.space) for progress on this and other builds.
