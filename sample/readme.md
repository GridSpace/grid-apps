# Application modules

This allows for the loading of server-side modules which can, in turn,
inject browser modules into applications like Kiri:Moto.

To enable the sample module:

- create a `mod` directory at the root of grid-apps
- copy the sample directory into the mod directory: `mod/sample`
- (re)start `gs-app-server`
- you will see log lines at start-up similar to this

```
220128.120432 '[head]' { module: './mod/sample/init.js' }
220128.120432 '[head]' '--- sample server-side module loaded ---'
```

- reloading Kiri:Moto from localhost, you will see these javascript
- console log messages indicaing the new module code is running

```
--- kiri main module start ---
--- kiri main module started ---
{server_said: 'received 39 bytes'}
--- kiri worker module start ---
--- kiri worker module started ---
```
