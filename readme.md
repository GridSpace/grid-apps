# Free and Open Source

Kiri:Moto and Mesh:Tool are completely open source and free for use without restriction. Over 12 years in development, this passion project has grown well beyond its original scope. It has consumed most of my free time for many years. Please consider donating to support continued development GitHub sponsorship or PayPal.

# Documentation
[Documentation](https://docs.grid.space/) -- Could really use help with this  

Docs are build with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) and served using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

You can build and view the docs locally with:
```
git clone git@github.com:GridSpace/grid-apps.git
cd grid-apps
npm run setup
npm run docs-dev
```

# HTML5 Web Apps (Installable)

[`Grid.Space`](https://grid.space) hosts [several live versions](https://grid.space/choose) of this code

[`Kiri:Moto`](https://grid.space/kiri) is a browser-based Slicer for 3D printers, CNC mills, and Laser cutters

[`Mesh:Tool`](https://grid.space/mesh) is a browser-based mesh repair and editing tool


# Electron Builds (Desktop Binaries)

https://github.com/GridSpace/grid-apps/releases/

Click on "Assets" under the release name to reveal files

Linux x86 requires the following to run:

```
sudo apt -y install fuse
chmod 755 KiriMoto-linux-x86_64.AppImage
./KiriMoto-linux-x86_64.AppImage --no-sandbox
```

The Windows and Mac binaries are not signed, so you will need to jump through a few safety hoops to get them to open the first time.
